        saunaText: `A Finnish sauna, which is proven to improve health and well-being, is also part of the wellness area. The skin, face, and entire body look better after spending time in the sauna. Muscles unwind, and a person's general psychological state gets better when they use a sauna. Regular use strengthens the body's defense mechanisms, burns calories, reduces stress, and allows pores to naturally open and perspiration naturally expels dust, dead skin, and pollutants. It is not surprising that one of our visitors' favorite spots is the sauna in our wellness area, because it was constructed with the best materials and can accommodate four people.`,
